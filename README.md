# q-learning
Simple q-learning implementation

### The project

This project was made to help me have a better undestanding of q-learning in practice. It solves the `Froken Lake` environment but probably can be adapted to others as well.

### Study

I'm currently studying reinforcement learning throught [University of Alberta Reinforcement Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)
